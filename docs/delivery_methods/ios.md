# iOS Notification Delivery Method

Send Apple Push Notifications with HTTP2 using the `apnotic` gem. The benefit of HTTP2 is that we can receive feedback for invalid device tokens without running a separate feedback service like RPush does.

```bash
bundle add "apnotic"
```

## Usage

```ruby
class CommentNotification
  deliver_by :ios
end
```

With custom configuration:

```ruby
class CommentNotification
  deliver_by :ios, format: :ios_format, cert_path: :ios_cert_path, key_id: :ios_key_id, team_id: :ios_team_id, pool_size: 5

  # Customize notification
  # See https://github.com/ostinelli/apnotic#apnoticnotification
  def ios_format(apn)
    apn.alert = "Hello world"
    apn.custom_payload = { url: root_url }
  end

  def ios_cert_path
    Rails.root.join("config/certs/ios/apns.p8")
  end

  def ios_key_id
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:ios, :key_id)
  end

  def ios_team_id
    Rails.application.credentials.dig(:ios, :team_id)
  end
end
```
